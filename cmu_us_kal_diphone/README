This directory contains a typical US diphone voice built using the
simplest diphone method specified in the festvox document
(http://www.festvox.org/festvox/) in section "US/UK English
Walkthrough" Note although this is based on the same recordings as the
distributed festvox_kal*.tar.gz voice this version does not have the
tidy ups that the standard release has.

The included recordings are actually the KAL voice (again), as taken
from (http://www.festvox.org/databases/cmu_us_kal_diphone/).
Here we assume there is no LAR files (even though there were in that
original recording) and appropriate parameters have been set in
bin/make_pm_wave to extract the pitchmarks from waveforms directly.

Note there has ben *NO* tidy up to phone labels, power, or ptichmakrs
which can make a real difference to the end quality.  This is release
as an pedagogical example, our real release of the diphone voice
based on these recording has a number of extra corrections

There *NO* need to copy this whole directory, Everthing is derivable
from the festvox document, except the files in the wav/ directory

The directory structure is 
 bin/
     basic scripts for building prompts, labelling feature files etc.s
 cep/
     Ceptrum files dynamically created in phone autolabellingl
 dic/
     Final diphone dictionary final (used at run-time)
 etc/
     prompt file, and some labelling templates 
 festival/
     Not used in diphone bases
 festvox/
     scheme voice definition files (used at run-time)
 group/
     extracted diphones into signle group file for distribution
 lab/
     autolabelled phone labels
 lar/
     recorded EGG signal files (not used in this example)
 lpc/
     LPC parameters plus residuals, (used at run-time for nongrouped version)
 mcep/
     MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) not used in diphone databases
 pm/
     Pitchmark files as extract from waveforms (or EGG signal)
 pm_lab/
     derived pitchmark labeled files from pm/ enabling emulabel (and others
     display programs) to show the pitchmarks and waveform files.
 prompt-cep/
     cepstrum files for
 prompt-lab/
     label files for synthesized prompts 
 prompt-wav/
     waveforms of synthesized prompts
 wav/
     recorded spoken nonsense words (in Microsoft riff (wav) format).
     If you are using Xwaves you should convert these to NIST format
 wrd/
     word label files (not usedin diphone databases)
